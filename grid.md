# Draw a grid

<img src="img/grid.png" alt="Demo of turtle drawing a 3x3 grid" width="50%"/>

## Part 1

Using the turtle library, draw a square where each side is 20 pixels long. Use a for loop to avoid code repetition. Each iteration of the for loop should draw one side of the square.

## Part 2

Using nested loops, draw 3 squares in a row side by side. Then, draw 3 rows of three squares to make a grid. Pay attention to proper indentation. You can use the function calls `speed(0)` to speed up the drawing, or `delay(0)` to go even faster for testing.

## Extra

- If you used for loops, recreate your program using while loops, and vice versa.
- Ask the user for the number of rows and columns the grid should have and draw accordingly
- Currently, many edges are being traced more than once. Implement a more efficient way to draw the grid.
