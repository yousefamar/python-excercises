# Create a calculator

## Part 1

Write a program that asks the user for two numbers, then outputs the sum of these numbers. For example, if the user inputs `5` and `4`, the output should be `9`.

## Part 2

Extend your program to additionally ask the user for a basic arithmetic operator. The output should then be the result of the operation on the two numbers. For example, if the user inputs `5`, `4`, and `-`, the output should be `1`.

## Extra

Consider what the program does when you give it an unknown operator or other bad input. Then extend your program to accept three more uncommon arithmetic operators:

| Name     | Symbol |
|----------|--------|
| Modulus  | `%`    |
| Quotient | `//`   |
| Exponent | `**`   |

See if you can reverse engineer what these operators do by testing your program with different inputs to determine a pattern.
